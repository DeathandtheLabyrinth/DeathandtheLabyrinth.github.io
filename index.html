  <p class="paragraph_header" id="Of Fire and War">On Fire and War </p>

<p class ="tab">In the beginning there was fire and it was the hottest and brightest fire because its fuel was itself. Fire burning fire becoming hotter and stronger
 to infinity. We are well aware of the maxim commonly circulated, whose origin belongs to Heraclitus that “ You can never step into the same River
  twice” - it is odd that the Philosopher of fire’s most famous inquiry into the nature of things would be a parable about water - for Heraclitus Fire
   was the principle force of the cosmos, earth is after all, like a hot coal burning from the spark of the sun. </p>


   <p class ="tab">If only the Fire could control itself then it would burn much longer. But Fire burns both lavishly and luxuriously, in an intensity that is stupor.
 In the Passions of the Soul, Rene Descartes likens the heart to a great “fire kept going by the blood from the veins, and this fire is the bodily 
 principle of the movements of our limbs” and the nerves “are like little filaments or pipes all coming from the brain; and, like the brain, they 
 contain a highly subtle air or wind known as the animal spirits… their properties are that they are very small and fast moving, like the parts of 
 the flame that comes from a torch” </p>

 <p class ="tab">And so the Body is like a machine, composed of canals and pipes, gears and pulleys, powered by the heat of the heart, commanded from the seat of the
 soul:</p>
 <br>
 <img src="C:\Users\alcin\website\marsretro.jpg" style="float:left;width:200px;height:350px;border:10px solid white;">
 <p class ="tab">“There is a little Gland in the brain in which the soul exercises it functions” that against common belief, which places the soul in “the brain
  or perhaps the heart; the brain because the sense organs are connected to it; the heart because that is where we seem to feel our passions” the
   pineal gland is “suspended over the channel through which the spirits of the anterior cavities communicate with those of the posterior cavity in 
   such a way that the slightest movements that take place within it can do much to change the flow of these spirits; while conversely, the slightest
    changes in the flow of the spirits can have a major effect on the movements of the gland.” </p>

    <p class ="tab">The Soul “having its main seat in the little gland in the middle of the brain, radiates outwards to the rest of the body through agency of the spirits,
  the nerves and even the blood, which, since it reflects the impressions of the spirits, can carry them along the arteries to all our limbs”</p>


 This is the famous Ghost in the Machine.<br>


 <p class ="tab">Desiring Machines are emblematic of cosmic fire, probably because like fire, the desiring machine yearns. Desire consumes luxuriously at the fuel 
 of the soul and spreads wildly amongst its milieu. It takes only a flicker to ignite its flame; a glance, a vapor, a sweet drop upon my tongue is 
 enough to excite its torch. It is Desire which always sets the house on Fire.</p>

 <p class ="tab">And there is War. From the smallest to the largest the Cosmos are Ares. Particles smashing  into Particles, rock into rubble,  life consuming life, 
and even the softest of elements gather into tornadoes and tsunamis. Everywhere in this great battle matter clings to itself in a game of the Will to
 Power. Let us call that drive to control the variables of the battle the will to power. Against the onslaught of forces the Will to Power is that 
 force keeps a thing together - a force breakable only by another opposing force. Bodies held together by this Power seek out other bodies which agree
  with their own - their combination creates more power. Man for example seeks water to bring him power and consumes a body of alcohol which decomposes
   his body and reduces his power. </p>

   <p class ="tab">War imagery has always been poetically inclined towards Red and it is for this reason Mars has always been the god star of war. It is a powerful 
resemblance that binds all these images to fire and it is fire which ultimately erases them. Fire effaces the face of things, reduces them to ash
 and it is this image of ash which is closest to the absence of things, its negative, its NOTHINGNESS that we will ever approach.</p>

 <p class="paragraph_header" id="Water and Reflection">Water and Reflection</p>


	<p class ="tab">My eyes glide over the shimmering surface of the pool and catch it sizzling; the sparkling glint drawn along its boundary. Sizzling because the water 
  is captured. When I encounter the water it is only an immediate impression which leaves me with itself: in fact the water is captured by the light.
   There is the water and there is light, running in pairs along the surface throwing up sparkles as they meet, evaporating into vapor. </p>

	
   <p class ="tab"> Along the surface of the canopy I see the reflection which is the representation of the capture. Light as pure reflection is just illumination;
   light as capture is now the waves painted along the underbelly of the canopy. This reflection shows me the water where it is not; and everywhere
    I find only the surface of the water. Noumena. </p>


    <p class ="tab"> 	When I dive into the pool, I am captured by the water. Its penetrating grip rushes to fill my lungs. From the depths of the water the surface reveals 
  a place captured by light and as I sink from this place it's chains on me disappears, it becomes blurry, warped and finally as I am carried by the 
  anchor of the water, it is lost in its darkness. Deep into that darkness I encounter the water itself and from here I lose myself and everywhere I
   once was is now Noumena and between us that immutable boundary throwing up sparkles, myself evaporating into that vapor past its horizon - like 
   the sun disappearing behind the skyline; like the moon meeting itself in ocean. </p>

   <p class="paragraph_header" id="Preliminary Remarks">Preliminary Remarks</p>

	<p class ="tab">How do we arrange the objects of our experience? 	We arrange things, be they mental or physical by ordering them. Particular things are marked 
    with an identity, corresponding to its characteristics and Like things are ordered into general categories which are called concepts. To establish
     the likeness of two objects, insomuch as to even give them the same name, we look past their differences; be this by convention, or habit. Take
      for instance the general category of a “Lake” which consists of such vagueness we assign it that identity of “a large body of water surrounded by
       land” - picture Lake Michigan, its surface area is 22,404 sq.mi and consists of  1.3 quadrillion gallons of blue water. Lake Hillier by contrast
        is almost perfectly round and filled with luminous pink water. Lake Wallula is a man-made body of water and Lake Poopó is nearly all mud. </p>

        <p class ="tab">Despite the almost innumerable differences between like objects, with a certain pompous and epistemic certainty we call these things “Lakes” and are
 done with them all together - it is no wonder Man has forgotten the beauty of nature for in a world where everything is lake nothing is different and
  everything is a monotonous bore.

  <p class ="tab">Perhaps the power of Surrealism has been to tear the familiar and certain objects from their categories and place them into new ones, or to leave them
 uncertain and forever unrecognizable to the faculty of understanding. By placing things where they don’t belong, as when Lautreamont united the
  Umbrella and the Sewing Machine or when Roussel united the Bust of Immanuel Kant to a skeleton of whale bones suspended atop a train car, a feeling
   of uneasiness occupies us -  the uncanny stupor is often described as psychedelic, akin to a drug or a gestalt shift. The objects of our experience
    are suddenly ordered in a different and now contradictory nature, revealing the wobbly ground they stood upon, the certain vertigo of our experience.
  
    <p class ="tab"> A thought experiment often appealed to by Enlightenment philosophers was that of a blind man suddenly returned to sight. Would they suddenly know 
    the beauty of flowers? That the mirror was an illusion, that shadows belong not to the body which projects them? The seventeenth-century philosopher
     William Molyneux, whose wife was blind, posed the following question to his friend John Locke:</p>

     <p class ="tab">  “Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the
     same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which is the sphere. Suppose then the cube and the sphere placed
      on a table, and the blind man made to see: query, Whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the 
      globe, which is the cube? To which the acute and judicious proposer answers: 'Not. For though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, and
       how a cube, affects his touch; yet he has not yet attained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so…”</p>
    
       <p class ="tab">Locke considers this in his 1690 Essay Concerning Human Understanding and decides that the answer is no. In 1709, examining the problem in more
      detail, and the whole relation between sight and touch, in A New Theory of Vision, George Berkeley concluded that there was no necessary connection
       between a tactile world and a sight world—that a connection between them could be established only on the basis of experience.</p>

       <p class ="tab">“the objects to which he had hitherto used to apply the terms up and down, high and low, were such as only affected or were in some way perceived by
     touch; but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas, perfectly distinct and different from the former, and which can in no sort make
      themselves perceived by touch.”</p>
      
      <p class ="tab"> For Berkeley our sensations are not causally connected; the production of ideas from our respective senses are independent from one another and 
      only become united in the field of experience. Barely twenty years elapsed before these considerations were put to the test—when, in 1728, William
       Cheselden, an English surgeon, removed the cataracts from the eyes of a thirteen-year-old boy born blind. Despite his high intelligence and youth,
        the boy encountered profound difficulties with the simplest visual perceptions. He had no idea of distance. He had no idea of space or size. And
         he was bizarrely confused by drawings and paintings, by the idea of a two-dimensional representation of reality. As Berkeley had anticipated,
          he was able to make sense of what he saw only gradually and insofar as he was able to connect visual experiences with tactile ones. It had 
          been similar with many other patients in the two hundred and fifty years since Cheselden’s operation: nearly all had experienced the most
           profound, Lockean confusion and bewilderment.</p>

           <p class ="tab"> In Oliver Sack’s book, An Anthropologist on Mars, the Molyneux problem is reviewed in a case involving a fifty year old man named Virgil who is restored
     to sight after having been virtually blind since the age of three. Following an operation to remove the cataracts that blocked his sight, Virgil 
     realized that sight is deceptively said to belong to the retina:</p>

     <p class ="tab">  “Virgil told me later that in this first moment he had no idea what he was seeing. There was light, there was movement, there was color, all mixed
     up, all meaningless, a blur. Then out of the blur came a voice that said, “Well?” Then, and only then, he said, did he finally realize that this 
     chaos of light and shadow was a face—and, indeed, the face of his surgeon.</p>

     <p class ="tab">His experience was virtually identical to that of Gregory’s patient S.B., who was accidentally blinded in infancy, and received a corneal transplant
     in his fifties:</p>

     <p class ="tab"> When the bandages were removed—he heard a voice coming from in front of him and to one side: he turned to the source of the sound, and saw a “blur.”
     He realized that this must be a face—He seemed to think that he would not have known that this was a face if he had not previously heard the voice and 
     known that voices came from faces.</p>

     <p class ="tab">  The rest of us, born sighted, can scarcely imagine such confusion. For we, born with a full complement of senses, and correlating these, one with the 
    other, create a sight world from the start, a world of visual objects and concepts and meanings. When we open our eyes each morning, it is upon a
     world we have spent a lifetime learning to see. We are not given the world: we make our world through incessant experience, categorization, memory,
      reconnection. But when Virgil opened his eye, after being blind for forty-five years—having had little more than an infant’s visual experience,
       and this long forgotten—there were no visual memories to support a perception; there was no world of experience and meaning awaiting him.
        He saw, but what he saw had no coherence. His retina and optic nerve were active, transmitting impulses, but his brain could make no sense of 
        them; he was, as neurologists say, agnosic.</p>

        <p class ="tab">  Everyone, Virgil included, expected something much simpler. A man opens his eyes, light enters and falls on the retina: he sees. It is as simple
     as that, we imagine. And the surgeon’s own experience, like that of most ophthalmologists, had been with the removal of cataracts from patients
      who had almost always lost their sight late in life—and such patients do indeed, if the surgery is successful, have a virtually immediate
       recovery of normal vision, for they have in no sense lost their ability to see. And so, though there had been a careful surgical discussion
        of the operation and of possible postsurgical complications, there was little discussion or preparation for the neurological and psychological
         difficulties that Virgil might encounter.</p>

         <p class ="tab">  On one occasion, he was puzzled by seeing “a fat airplane” in the sky—“stuck, not moving.” It turned out to be a blimp. Occasionally, he had seen 
    birds; they made him jump, sometimes, if they came too close. (Of course, they did not come that close, Amy explained. Virgil simply had no idea
     of distance.)” </p>
    
     
    

  <p class ="tab">[What Conclusion does the West draw from Free Will and the Nature of their experience?] He says: My will was the sole rational force involved. Failure came about by chance."To speak of chance is to negate the possibility of any law of cause and effect. Chance is the one final irrationality acceptable to the free will."Without the concept of chance, you see, the Western philosophy of free will could never have arisen. Chance is the crucial refuge of the will. And without it the very thought of gambling would be inconceivable, just as the Westerner has

    no other way of rationalizing the repeated setbacks and frustrations that he must endure. I think that this concept of chance, of a gamble, is the very substance of the God of Europeans, and so they have a deity whose characteristics are derived from that refuge so vital to free will, namely chance: the only sort of God who would inspire the freedom of human will. "But what would happen if we were to deny the existence of chance completely? What would happen if no matter what the victory or the defeat-you had to exclude utterly all possible role of chance in it? In that case, you'd be destroying all refuge of free will. Do away with chance and you under-
    
    mine the props under the concept of the will.</p>

    
    <p class ="tab"> "Picture a scene like this: it's a square at midday. The will is standing there all alone. He pretends that he is remaining upright by virtue of his own strength, and hence he goes on deceiving himself. The sun beats down. No trees, no grass. Nothing whatever in the huge square to keep him company but his own shadow. At that moment, a thundering voice comes down from the cloudless sky above: Chance is dead. There's no such thing as chance. Hear me, Will: you have lost your advocate forever.? And with that, the Will feels his substance begin to crumble and dissolve. His flesh rots and falls away. In an instant his skeleton is laid bare, a thin liquid spurts from it, and the bones themselves lose their solidity and begin to disintegrate. The Will still stands with his feet planted firmly on the ground, but this final effort is futile. For at that very moment, the bright, glaring sky is rent apart with a terrible roar, and the God of Inevitability stares down through the chasm.
    
    “But I cannot help trying to conjure up an odious face for this dreadful God, and this weakness is doubtless due to my own bent toward voluntarism. For if Chance ceases to exist, then Will becomes meaningless--no more significant than a speck of rust on the huge chain of cause and effect that we only glimpse from time to time. Then there's only one way to participate in history, and that's to have no will at all-to function solely as a shining, beautiful atom, eternal and unchanging. No one should look for any other meaning in human existence.</p>
    
    
    <p class ="tab"> You are not likely to see things this way. I wouldn't expect you to subscribe to such a philosophy. The only things you do put any faith in~-and that without much thought-are
    
    your own good looks, your changing moods, your individuality and-not your fixed character, but on the contrary, your very lack of it. </p>
    

    <p class="paragraph_header">The Myth of the One</p>

    <p class ="tab">The call for a Henological Vibe shift is nothing new. It is a well welcomed stimulus to an otherwise lifeless discourse.</p>
    <p class ="tab">The doctrine of <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> is as old as Philosophy; arguably the tradition itself begins with the Parmendian positing of being. 
    Ontology, the study of being and Epistemology, the study of Knowledge form the two currents of Philosophy we are most familiar with 
    - Henology as inquiry into the nature of the ONE has been a theme running along the underbelly of all Philosophical thought and stands
    in sharp distinction to those who take being as their point of departure or seek to understand the nature of knowledge and its relation 
    to truth(essence).</p> 

  <p class ="tab">  A history of the ‘ordering codes’ - where being and knowledge meet in the manifold of experience -  is provided by Foucault in the Order of
     Things and Deleuze in Difference and Repetition . The former published in 1966 and the later in 1968 served as fresh soil for Critical
      Philosophy, or at the very least a way around the alluring flux of French Hegelianism against the banality of existentialism. We are 
      not spared from Hegel’s gambit in Henology; an inquiry into the nature of the ONE falls prey to what Foucault called ‘Hegel’s trap’
       and our tendency to wander  like foxes into them. </p>

    <p class ="tab">The henological vibe shift finds its origin in the late and vastly underappreciated Reiner Schürmann whose work mirrors so many figures
         in the mid century french tradition and their tendency to recast the thought of old thinkers into new waters (ex. Deleuze’s Leibniz
          and Spinoza, Klossowski’s Sade and Nietzsche). The overdue release of Schurmann’s work in English will hopefully release us from the
           tired readings of Foucault and Marx. His positive work in Broken Hegemonies should inspire us towards new horizons: For Schurmann,
            Henology is a "metaphysics of radical transcendence" that extends beyond being towards what his contemporary called a “Plane
             of Immanence”. </p>

   <p class ="tab">There is a seismic shift within our culture towards a return to Mythos, over and against our fetish for logos, as the dominant paradigm of our 
    thought. We are tempted, as Paglia would, to address this to our “cyclical" nature; but this would ignore the obvious differences
     which are paramount. I do not mean Mythos in a derogatory way and do not confuse me with those lackluster and soulless atheists whose 
     arrogant sophistries are disappearing all around us. </p>

     <p class ="tab">"The force that builds up tidal waves, that makes the sea lap at the moon, that has lava rising from the depths of volcanoes; the force that
         shakes buildings and creates deserts; the force red and unpredictable that sends thoughts like so many crimes seething through our heads,
          and crimes innumerable, like lice; the force that supports and aborts life these are concrete manifestations of an energy whose heavier
           aspect is the Sun." {Page 72. Heliogabalus, the Crowned Anarchist, Anton Artaud}</p>

          
	<p class ="tab"> 1. Energy over Material, pressure opposed to force; Bataille describes a fluid economy. Energy is power and proceeds by the law of entropy - it tends
     towards stasis and ultimately nothingness. In Living beings, energy takes on the appearance of power and a living thing ultimately possesses a will
      to power. In Social formations this Will to Power takes on the ruse of familiar games: Sexuality and its proverbial language Eroticism, Morality
       and its correspondence of values ordered into hierarchies, Religion, Science and even Reason itself. This will to annihilation (the destiny of
        energy as nothingness) is but one aspect of the curse. </p>
        
      <p class ="tab">2. Rather than take poetry and metaphor as a point of departure I would like to describe a topology: The Cosmological/Terrestrial General
             Economy is a network that functions as a circuit. The energy distribution within the network is fluid and is therefore analogous to plumbing
              - dispersion in the form of flows at various pressures. </p>
      <p class ="tab">  3. Pressure emanates from the valve and is received on Earth. For Life, simple organisms like those of cells synthesize energy from the Sun; their
        reproduction is scissoric. In a sense its more accurate to say that cells never reproduce and that all cells are derivative from the first.
         When life takes on a certain magnitude, an organism becomes complex and enters into relations which modify its condition - by virtue of its
        existence or intent. Complex organisms naturally enter into relations defined by luxury. </p>


        
        <p class ="tab">“I said that reproduction was opposed to eroticism, but while it is true that eroticism is defined by the mutual independence of erotic pleasure and reproduction as an end, the fundamental meaning of repro-duction is none the less the key to eroticism.
        
        Reproduction implies the existence of discontinuous beings. Beings which reproduce themselves are distinct from one another, and those reproduced are likewise distinct from each other, just as they are distinct from their parents. Each being is distinct from all others. His birth, his death, the events of his life may have an interest for others, but he alone is directly concerned in them. He is born alone. He dies alone. Between one being and another, there is a gulf, a discontinuity.
        
        This gulf exists, for instance, between you, listening to me, and me, speaking to you. We are attempting to communicate, but no communication between us can abolish our funda- mental difference. If you die, it is not my death. You and I are discontinuous beings.
        
        But I cannot refer to this gulf which separates us without feeling that this is not the whole truth of the matter. It is a deep gulf, and I do not see how it can be done away with. Nonetheless, we can experience its dizziness together. It can hypnotize us. This gulf is death in one sense, and death is vertiginous, death is hypnotizing.
        
        It is my intention to suggest that for us, discontinuous beings that we are, death means continuity of being. Reproduction leads to the discontinuity of beings, but brings into play their continuity; that is to say, it is intimately linked with death. I shall endeavor to show, by discussing repro- duction and death, that death is to be identified with con- tinuity, and both of these concepts are equally fascinating. This fascination is the dominant element in eroticism.
        
        I am about to deal with a basic disturbance, with something that turns the established order topsy-turvy. The facts I shall take as a starting-point, will at first seem neutral, objective, scientific and apparently indistinguishable from other facts which no doubt do concern us, but remotely, and without bringing to bear any factors which touch us closely. This apparent insignificance is misleading but I shall take it first at its face value, just as if I did not intend to Jet the cat out of the bag the next minute.
        
        You know that living creatures reproduce themselves in two ways; elementary organisms through asexual reproduction, complex ones through sexual reproduction.
        
        In asexual reproduction, the organism, a single cell, divides at a certain point in its growth. Two nuclei are formed and from one single being two new beings are derived. But we 'cannot say that one being has given birth to a second being. The two new beings are equally products of the first. The first being has disappeared. It is to all intents and purposes dead, in that it does not survive in either of the two beings it has produced. It does not decom- pose in the way that sexual animals do when they die, but it ceases to exist. It ceases to exist in so far as it was discontinuous. But at one stage of the reproductive process there was continuity. There is a point at which the original one becomes two. As soon as there are two, there is again dis- continuity for each of the beings. But the process entails one instant of continuity between the two of them. The first one dies, but as it dies there is this moment of continuity between the two new beings.
        
        The same continuity cannot occur in the death of sexual creatures, where reproduction is in theory independent of death and disappearance. But sexual reproduction, basically a matter of cellular division just like asexual reproduction, brings in a new kind of transition from discontinuity to continuity. Sperm and ovum are to begin with discontinuous entities, but they unite, and consequently a continuity comes into existence between them to form a new entity from the death and disappearance of the separate beings. The new entity is itself discontinuous, but it bears within itself the transition to continuity, the fusion, fatal to both, of two separate beings.
        
        Insignificant as these changes may seem, they are yet fundamental to all forms of life. In order to make them clear, I suggest that you try to imagine yourself changing from the state you are in to one in which your whole self is completely doubled; you cannot survive this process since the doubles you have turned into are essentially different from you. Each of these doubles is necessarily distinct from you as you are now. To be truly identical with you, one of the doubles would have to be actually continuous with the other, and not distinct from it as it would have become. Imagination boggles at this grotesque idea. If, on the other hand, you imagine a fusion between yourself and another human being similar to that between the sperm and the ovum, you can quite easily picture the change we are talking about.

  In conclusion, <BR>
        
      <P class ="tab">  Erotic activity, by dissolving the separate beings that participate in it, reveals their fundamental continuity, like the waves of a stormy sea.
         In sacrifice, the victim is divested not only of clothes but of life (or is destroyed in some way if it is an inanimate object). The victim dies
          and the spectators share in what his death reveals. This is what religious historians call the element of sacredness.
           This sacredness is the revelation of continuity through the death of a discontinuous being to those who watch it as a solemn rite.
            A violent death disrupts the creature's dis- continuity; what remains, what the tense onlookers experience in the succeeding silence,
             is the continuity of all existence with which the victim is now one. Only a spec- tacular killing, carried out as the solemn and collective 
             nature of religion dictates, has the power to reveal what normally escapes notice. We should incidentally be unable to imagine what goes on 
             in the secret depths of the minds of the bystanders if we could not call on our own personal religious experiences, if only childhood ones.
              Everything leads us to the conclusion that in essence the sacramental quality of primitive sacrifices is analagous to the comparable element in contemporary religions.

     <p class ="tab">4. The practical application of a notion of economy predicted by a reflection on the cosmological and fluid dynamism (effervescence) is in a
         simple and familiar assertion: We possess a share of life and this share cannot be returned, it can be squandered or it can radiate. It takes
          its ethical imperative here: if one is aware of their curse, it is within their power to break it given they know the password. The problem 
          is, the general economy is literally sizzling (which is why Battaie stresses effervescence so much). Its image is effaced by the sheer 
          intensity of the Sun’s pressure; we are being slow cooked and giving way to spent fuel. The Aztecs interpreted this slow cook, matter 
          sizzling, as evidence of the nature of Man as luxurious food. Afterall, it was because the Gods were hungry that they made a fire, to 
          which Nanahuatzin and Tecuciztecatl committed luxurious goods and ultimately themselves to. In order for the Sun to rise, one must fuel
           the tank. It is important to remark, as Bataille is so kindly to remind us constantly, that while my analogy is digestible, Mechanistic
            in kind and friendly to the automobile mechanic, it obscures a more essential point: for the Aztecs the Gods were personifications of Cosmic
             forces. Sacrifice was a condition of light/life - for energy to continue it must be spent and spent lavishly. </p>
                
      <p class ="tab">This is ofcourse is an outdated variation of the Mythology of the Accursed Share, we are well aware and with relative precision that the sun
         does not require flesh for subsistence. Other mythologies posist the Accursed Share as potlatch: as a gift which cannot be returned. It’s 
         offered freely to you, not because it was necessarily derived without expenditure or loss but as a ruse of the Will to Power. Whether in the 
         form of a trojan horse or good will (intent) its objective is but a reflection of the Will to Power (will as vital force to things in
          themselves). So Batallie concludes with  the problem that began this thesis: If a corpulent system forgos its squandered energy in the form 
          of a gift to an impoverished congruent system belonging to the same network the result is net a gain for the total network if the impoverished
           system is progressing towards its normative state: productiveness. In War squandered energy is leveled and dispersed, in turn this creates the 
           conditions for growth - it resets effervescence towards its normative state. The pressure is prevented by cascading from the danger point to a
            normative state of effervescence. Bataille reflects on how very arbitrary this all is, how simple the password is viewed from the perspective
             of General Economy; the louder theaters of Geopolitics are nothing but circus and grotesque festivities that obscure the Sun as anarchy and 
             the practical distribution of energy in Communism (gift giving; “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need”) : </p>
                
               
       <p class ="tab">from the perspectives of restrictive economy to those of general economy actually accomplishes a Copernican transformation: a reversal of
         thinking - and of ethics. If a part of wealth (subject to a rough estimate) is doomed to destruction or at least to unproductive use without
          any possible profit, it is logical, even inescapable, to surrender commodities without return. Henceforth, leaving aside pure and simple
           dissipation, analogous to the construction of the Pyramids, the possibility of pursuing growth is itself subordinated to giving: 
           The industrial development of the entire world demands of Americans that they lucidly grasp the necessity, for an economy such as theirs, 
           of having a margin of profitless operations. An immense industrial network cannot be managed in the same way that one changes a tire.... 
           It expresses a circuit of cosmic energy on which it depends, which it cannot limit, and whose laws it cannot ignore without consequences.
            Woe to those who, to the very end, insist on regulating the movement that exceeds them with the narrow mind of the mechanic who changes a 
            tire. (pg 26)</p>
                
               <p class ="tab"> “As for the present historical situation, it is characterized by the fact that judgments concerning the general situation proceed 
                from a particular point of view. As a rule, particular existence always risks succumbing for lack of resources. It contrasts with general 
                existence whose resources are in excess and for which death has no meaning. From the particular point of view, the problems are posed in
                 the first instance by a deficiency of resources. They are posed in the first instance by an excess of resources if one starts from the 
                 general point of view. Doubtless the problem of extreme poverty remains in any case. Moreover, it should be understood that general economy 
                 must also, whenever possible and first of all, envisage the development of growth. But if it considers poverty or growth, it takes into
                  account the limits that the one and the other cannot fail to encounter and the dominant (decisive) character of the problems that follow
                   from the existence of surpluses. Briefly considering an example, the problem of extreme poverty in India cannot immediately be dissociated 
                   from the demographic growth of that country, or from the lack of proportion with its industrial development. India's possibilities of
                    industrial growth cannot themselves be dissociated from the excesses of American resources. A typical problem of general economy emerges
                     from this situation. On the one hand, there appears the need for an exudation; on the other hand, the need for a growth. The present state 
                     of the world is defined by the unevenness of the (quantitative or qualitative) pressure exerted by human life. General economy suggests,
                      therefore, as a correct operation, a transfer of American wealth to India without reciprocation. This proposal takes into account the
                       threat to America that would result from the pressure - and the imbalances of pressure - exerted in the world by the developments
                        of Hindu life. These considerations necessarily give first priority to the problem of war, which can be clearly regarded only in 
                        the light of a fundamental ebullition. The only solution is in raising the global standard of living under the current moral conditions,
                         the only means of absorbing the American surplus, thereby reducing the pressure to below the danger point.”</p>
                
               <p class ="tab"> “A curse obviously weighs on human life insofar as it does not have the strength to control a vertiginous movement. It must be stated as a 
                principle, without hesitation, that the lifting of such a curse depends on man and only on man. But it cannot be lifted if the movement from 
                which it emanates does not appear clearly in con­sciousness. In this regard it seems rather disappointing to have nothing more to propose, as a
                 remedy for the catastrophe that threatens, than the "raising of the living standard." This recourse, as I have said, is linked to a refusal 
                 to see, in its truth, the exigency to which the recourse is intended to respond.” (40 -41) </p>
                
                <p class ="tab">This cannot be posited in a Moral sense, its ethics correspond to the nature of the curse (Metaphysical axiom).
                     Claims of justice or fairness escape the glimmering beauty of the curse. A science of the curse would be an erudition of the Statement of
                      the Curse itself (after all, don’t all curses proceed from utterances/incantation?). In practice this a hermeneutics of the symbol of its 
                      presence (the effect we feel, most transparently in the feeling of heat, the effervesce of our burning flesh)  </p>
                
                      <p class ="tab"> Under present conditions, everything conspires to obscure the basic movement that tends to restore wealth to its function, to gift-giving, 
                to squandering without reciprocation. On the one hand, mechanized warfare, producing its ravages, characterizes this movement as something alien,
                 hostile to human will. On the other hand, the raising of the standard of living is in no way represented as a requirement of luxury.
                  The movement that demands it is even a protest against the luxury of the great fortunes: thus the demand made in the name of justice.
                   Without having anything against justice, obviously, one may be allowed to point out that here the word conceals the profound truth of its
                    contrary, which is pre-. cisely freedom. Under the mask of justice, it is true that general freedom takes on the lackluster and neutral
                     appearance of existence subjected to the necessities: If anything, it is a narrowing of limits to what is most just; it is not a dangerous breaking-loose,
                      a meaning that the word has lost. It is a guarantee against the risk of servitude, not a will to assume those risks without which there is no freedom.  </p>
                
                <p>It’s no surprise that to those who have realized the universe as anarchy and communism are bound to the stars; the divinity of Love, the annihilation of the simple soul.

<p class ="tab"> For Heraclitus the only element is Fire and that the world is like a river caught in the to and throw of water. The Valve encloses, it limits 
    - even existence itself. </p>
    
    <p class ="tab">The consequence of flux has always marked the turning point, where reason acknowledges its own limits predicated on sensuous intuitions that 
    are themselves, empirically in Motion. Its why Socrates warned against it in the Cratylus, that with Heraclitus we are “spinning in a vortex”.
     It is why those in this tradition tend towards the form and the description of the ideal - the old play of identities and differences which 
     still defines our time - to the order of things and the description of lacunae, either in the form of the human geometer or the Divine - our 
     obsession with “Genesis” as opposed to Discontinuity, Multiplicity, the anarchy at the consequence of Mechanism itself, etc. </p>
    
     <p class ="tab">The critique of the order of things is patent in Bataille, it takes up the torch of Nietzsche and sets the groundwork for Foucault: how does 
    someone tame the wild profusion of existing things? How does one posist the identity and difference of objects that are, by virtue of the curse
     and schema of the mind, fundamentally continuous ? Being that language alone posits the “I”? The Order of Things falls into pure contingency,
      myth as the force of its ontology.

        <p class ="tab">  Heliogabalus early on had that sense of unity which is at the root of all myths and all names; and his decision to call himself Elagabalus and
         the zeal he showed in living down his family and name and in identifying himself with the god who protected them provides a first proof of his
          magical monotheism, not only of the word, but the deed.</p>
        
          <p class ="tab"> This monotheism he then introduced into the things he did. And it's the monotheism, the universal unity, that obstructs mere impulse and the

         <p class ="tab"> To have a sense of the profound unity of things is to have a sense of anarchy, and of the effort required to reduce things while restoring them
         to unity. Whoever has the sense of unity also has the sense of the multiplicity of things, of that dust of appearances through which one must
          pass in order to reduce and destroy them.</p>
        
          <p class ="tab"> And Heliogabalus, in so far as he was king, found himself in the best possible position to reduce human multiplicity and restore it through
         blood, cruelty and war to the sense of unity." </p>
        
        {63 - 64, Heliogabalus the Crowned Anarchist, Anton Artaud}
        </p>

        <p class ="tab">As for anyone who rakes up the gods of the ancient religions and stirs them around at the bottom of his hod as though with a streetcleaner's spiked stick; as for him who is driven crazy by the multiplicity of names; as for him who in straddling one country and another, finds similarities between the gods and the roots of an identical etymology in the names that make up these gods; and as for anyone who, having inspected all these names, the clues to their powers and the meaning of their attributes, complains about the polytheism of the ancients, whom he calls accordingly Barbarians - that person is himself a Barbarian, namely a European.

            If nations, as time progressed, made the gods in their own image; if they extinguished the phosphorescent idea of the gods and, having left the orbit of the names encircling them, they revealed themselves to be powerless to reascend via the concentric contacts of forces, via the diligent and concrete magnetization of energies, as far as the initial discharge, up 
            to the revelation of the principle which these gods wanted to manifest, one must historically and partially blame the nations not the principles - still less that superior and all-encompassing idea of the world which Paganism wished to restore to us. And since, deep down, ideas are only to be judged by their form, one may say that, trapped in time, the development of countless myths-paralleling within underground passages chockful of solar temples the stratified congestion of deities - no longer gives us an idea of that formidable cosmic tradition at the core of the pagan world, any more than the dances of oriental ballet and the stylised passes of the fakirs recently seen on European stages are likely to restore to us the sense of freedom without images or the mysterious commotion of images resulting from a genuinely sacred gesture.
            
            The holy spirit is that which cleaves firmly to principles with a dark force of identification resembling sexuality, sexuality on the level closest to our organic consciousness, our consciousness blocked by the depth of its fall. I wonder whether that fall does represent sin. For in the area where such matters arise, this identification goes by the name of Love, one form of which is universal charity and the other, the more terrible, becomes the sacrifice of the soul, meaning the death of individuality.
            
            All these struggles of god with god, power against power, the gods feeling those forces they are thought to control crackling at their fingertips; this separation of the power from the god, the god reduced to no more than a sort of word, falling, an effigy dedicated to the most hideous idolatries; this seismic din and physical convulsion in the heavens; this way of riveting sky into heaven, earth onto earth; these mansions and expanses of heaven which are handed on and pass from mind to mind, with each of us, inside our heads, refashioning our gods, this interim occupation of heaven, here by a god and his wrath, there by the same god mutated; this takeover of power, succeeded as though by the perpetual spasmodic pulsation, top to bottom and back again, of other takeovers of power; this respiration of cosmic faculties, similar, on a higher level to the coarse and buried faculties dormant within our own individual natures - and for every faculty there is a corresponding god and a power, and we are heaven on earth, and they have become the earth, the earth drawn into the absolute; - this stormy instability of the heavens which we call Paganism, and which sometimes strikes us blind and lashes us with its truths, is us, it's our Christian Europe, it's History that's fabricated it.
            
            To replace it in time, this proliferating deployment of the gods whom the nations in their historical progression spread out in turn, across the skies, - and often the same location in the visible sky is occupied by opposed images of nature, and these gods are man and woman, and the woman god overlays the masculine god's image, identical to hers; and Ishtar, a name originally masculine, ended up signifying the moon, the moon the selfsame point in space time encumbered with both phallus and Kreis [Paul: Greek word here, Couldnt copy the font], fucked herself and dispersed dew-tide of children; to replace time, footdragging around principles affects their initial validity more than principle of reproduction.
            
            If nations ended up considering gods as veritably separate, they mistook significance gods, we should note that each nation, taken isolation and the same time and space, always organise powers hierarchically, and that wherever a feminine one overlaid masculine one vice versa in minds and the people placed above them pedestals those essentially contradictory gods, the masculine masculine and feminine feminine no inversion of nomenclature possible; must say forthwith that name would apply to two forms, made, apparently, that might devour the other and the Syria of the era of Heliogabalus took to a supreme point the notion of this mysterious fusibility.
            
            What differentiates us from the pagans is that, at the root of all their beliefs, there is a dreadful effort not to believe in man, in order to maintain contact with the whole of creation, with divinity, that is.
            
            I know well enough that the smallest impulse of love brings us nearer God than all the knowledge we may have about creation and things." (72 - 76 Heliogabalus the Crowned Anarchist, Anton Artaud)

               <p> A Description of the Sun Temple:</p>
                
               <p class ="tab"> In Syria, the temples are sounding-boards for real marvels, magical revelation. And a considerable number of temples seemingly
                 placed there only to illustrate this war, these rites, these anomalies, vie with each other for splendour across the whole expanse
                  of Syria, some consecrated to the sun, others to the moon, without it being very easy to ascertain which is the female, which the
                   male, and whether it be the male that has generated the female or vice versa. There was the temple of the sun at Emesa, that
                    apparently had primacy over the other temples of the male sun, as if there were several suns, with each particular one being 
                    the double of all the others, and the moon were the female double of a single and masculine god; and the temple of the sun-moon
                     at Apamaea paved throughout with moonstones; and the one to the moon at Hierapolis, near Emesa, outwardly consecrated to womanhood,
                      comprising a male throne stunted and reduced, displayed no more than once a year and under the aegis of Apollo. Apollo, 
                      signifiying the sun in motion upon its course, the sun freed from a part of himself, the highest, and considered in its powerful
                       momentum, the sun descended from his throne and who accepts getting down to work, who is no longer king since not enthroned, nor
                        immobile and is at work, and who has become the son of the king, as christ is son of God.</p>
                
                        <p> Lucian, a Greek author of the 12th century AD., tells of a visit he made to the temple of Astarte at Hierapolis.</p>
                
                Yet one might search in vain through his account for precise information as to the rites practised there. Nothing seems to have struck
                 him apart from a quite superficial picturesqueness: "The temple contains precious objects, ancient offertories, a host of wonderful objects, revered statues and deities ever-present.
                     Indeed, the statues there exude, move themselves and deliver oracles."</p>

                
                     <p class ="tab"> For if stones make sounds, if they fly, if they have breath, their own form of respiration, statues too have a breath that is without 
                doubt the spirit of the god.</p>
                
                <p class ="tab">   "Often", says Lucian, "a voice may be heard within the sanctuary when the temple is closed. Many have heard it."</p>
                
                    <p class ="tab">  We are to believe that once the temple opened, hoaxing became impossible. There will always be tricksters alongside initiates.</p>
                
                        <pclass ="tab" >"I have seen," continues Lucian, "the secret treasury of the temple wherein are stored relics, numberless riches: woven stuffs, 
                objects in gold and silver arranged separately.”</p>
                
                <p class ="tab">"The temple contains, moreover, elephant tusks, pottery, Ethiopian fabrics; inside the vestibule are to be seen two enormous phalloi.
                 One can also see in the temple precinct a small bronze of a seated man furnished with an enormous member.</p>

                    
                 <p class ="tab">"Even the location on which the temple of Hierapolis was built is a hill situated in the middle of the town. It is surrounded by two
                 high walls. One of these walls is ancient, the other does not long predate our own epoch. The propylaea extend to about a hundred 
                 spans (one hundred and sixty metres). Under these propylaea have been sited phalloi thirty spans high (forty eight metres). A man 
                 climbs up one of these phalloi twice a year and stays on its top for a week. Here is the reason for this ascent: the populace is
                  persuaded that the man on his lofty perch is conversing with the gods, asking them for prosperity throughout Syria, and that the 
                  latter may thus hear his prayer the more clearly.</p>
                
                  <p class ="tab">  Others think the practice is in honour of Deucalion and a remembrance of that sad occasion when men fled to the mountains for fear
                 of the flood. (The temple of Hierapolis contained a hole through which the floodwater is said to have drained away.) In order to
                  ascend the phallus, the man would attach a thick rope around the phallus and his body, then climb with the aid of wooden struts 
                  projecting from the phallus and wide enough for him to set foot on. As he raised himself higher, he drew up the rope after him,
                   as charioteers draw in the reins. This we may never have witnessed, but anyone who has actually seen palm-trees climbed in Arabia
                    or Egypt or elsewhere will understand what I mean. Having reached the end of his climb, our man lets down another rope carried 
                    with him and, using this very long rope, pulls up to him everything he needs: wood, clothing, utensils. With all this he makes 
                    himself a home, a sort of nest, and sits there aloft for the period of time mentioned. Some among the crowd which assembles bring
                     him gold, others silver, others copper; the offerings are laid out in his view and the donor, supplying his name, withdraws,</p>

                    <p class ="tab">  It's here we get onto the scent of woman. If, instead of giving us an external description of the temple of Hierapolis - and his
                 description is never more external than when he appears to gain access to, and penetrate, its inmost secrets -Lucian had had the
                  slightest curiosity about principles, he would have examined the temple colonnades as to the extrahuman origin of those female sexes 
                  in stone which comprise the ornamentation thereon. This is the very principle of lonian architecture.</p>
                

                  <p class ="tab">  But let us return to his documentary description. This description has the advantage of establishing a certain number of details, concrete though superficial, and it defines this
                 innate taste for decorum, this love of marvels real or false, among a race for whom the theatre was not on a stage, but in life.</p>

                
                 <p class ="tab"> "A foundation raised two spans above ground level. Upon this foundation rests the temple. Entering it, one is seized with admiration:
                 the doors are golden, inside gold shines everywhere, gleaming over the whole vault. One can smell a pleasant odour therein, similar 
                 to that which they say perfumes Arabia. The further one has journeyed, the more one inhales this delicious fragrance, and on departure
                  it leaves one not, clothing is deeply steeped in it and thus one always preserves the memory thereof. Within, inside a remote chamber
                   are set the statues of Jupiter and Juno, to whom the town's inhabitants give names drawn from their own dialect. These two statues 
                   are of gold, and sedentary: Juno on lions, Jupiter upon bulls. The statue of Juno holds in one hand a sceptre, in the other a 
                   distaff; her head, crowned with rays of light, supports a turret and is girdled by a diadem which ordinarily adorns only the brow 
                   of Urania. Her raiment is covered with gold and extremely precious gemstones, some whitish, others clear as water, a great number 
                   fiery in hue; there are onyx sards, Egyptian jacinths, emeralds brought her by Indians, Medes, Armenians and Babylonians.</p>
                

                   <p class ="tab">"The statue bears upon its head a diamond known as The Lamp. This casts during the night so bright a radiance that the temple is 
                illuminated by it as by torches; during the day this light is far fainter: the jewel does however retain some of its fire. There
                 is yet another marvel pertaining to this statue; if you look at it from the front, she looks back at you, but if you move away, 
                 her gaze follows you. If another person applies the same test from another side, the statue does not fail to do likewise.</p>
                
                 <p class ="tab">"Between these two statues may be seen a third, of gold also, but having nothing in common with the other two. This is the Semeion: 
                she wears on her head a golden dove.</p>
                
                <p class ="tab">"On entering to the left of the temple, one finds a throne reserved for the Sun, but the figure of this god is not there; the Sun
                 and Moon are the only two deities whose images they do not show, for they say there is no purpose in making statues of deities who
                  show themselves every day in the sky."</p>
                
                  <p class ="tab"> The cult of Baal at Emesa represented by the vigorous prick of Elagabal, the black god, paralleled, through its complex and overloaded 
                rites, the cult of Tanith-Astarte, the moon, which held sway a few kilometres away, in the fragrant depths of the temple of Hierapolis.
                 There it was, in this temple consecrated to woman's vagina, to her deified sex, that a sweating and bearded Apollo would emerge during
                  the main festivals and would consecrate his oracles through the voice of the high priest, advancing or retiring upon the shoulders of
                   his bearers. This Apollo all in gold, with a thick fringe of black horsehair affixed beneath his chin, arrives borne on mens' backs,
                    carried by a dozen or so tottering bearers who can scarcely manage to support his weight. The crowd bows down. The incense rises, 
                    as if streaming from every orifice. At the far end of the temple, the high priest awaits the god, - himself painted with insignia,
                     laden with gemstones, rags, feathers; erect, frail, like a bull's tongue in air, dripping gold. In the silence that has suddenly 
                     fallen, footsteps are heard, voices, comings and goings of every sort in the building's underground ZONE rooms, all this comprising
                      layers, superimposed storeys of whispers and noises. Beneath the earth, the temple spirals down toward the depths, the chambers 
                      for the rituals are stacked one upon the other in vertical succession; it's as if the temple resembles a vast theatre where 
                      everything would be real.</p>
                
                      <p class ="tab"> At the moment of the appearance of the god, the drunken god who makes his guardians stagger, the temple vibrates in harmony with
                 the stratified vortices of the basements, known of and located since remotest antiquity. In the ritual chambers reaching down to 
                 several hundred metres below ground level, the watchers pass the word, give voice, strike gongs, and make the horns moan so the vaults
                  resound with echoes.</p>
                
                  <p class ="tab">  On the wing of cries, on rolling clouds of incense and noise, like moving masses of smoke, the high priest interrogates the oracle, 
                sounds him out, invokes him with great shouts, rhythmically. Then one sees the madman-god, whose beard forms a great black hole in the
                 midst of the gold in which he is utterly drowned; one sees the god grow agitated, foam at the mouth as if beset by rabies or stricken
                  with inspiration.</p>
                

                  <p> If the oracle is favourable, if the response of the oracle is</p>
                
                    <p> yes</p>
                
                        <p> the god pushes his bearers forwards.</p>
                
                            <p> If the oracle is unfavourable, if the response of the oracle is</p>
                
                                <p> "no",</p>
                
                                    <p> the god pulls his bearers backwards.</p>
                
                                        <p class ="tab"> Lucian himself claims one day to have seen this god, of the questions put to him, free himself from the grasp weary of his guards 
                and take a sudden flying leap upwards. One can picture the crowd, smitten with a kind of religious terror, rushing out of the temple,
                 trampling over the parvis, crushing each other and swirling round the two great phalloi tall as pylons, temporarily superfluous, for
                  all their few hundred cubits of height.

<p class ="tab">We are but statues on the surface of <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i>. But what am I? Every moment is a moment that is passing, so I am an illusion.
     The I that I am is not the I that I was when I started reading this paragraph, nor is it the I of ten years ago. 

But every I, which existed at a moment like this one, is preserved as a statue. So when I die, I will return but that return will be different for it
 will not be the I that I am presently or at death. Every moment is a moment that is different, but every moment that will be returned indefinitely.
  I do not mean reincarnation, I mean that every moment is all that there is and all that will be and every birth and every death of the I is one that
   it will experience forever.

This I call <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i>. If we search our reason and our feelings we know this to be the case. Reason tells us nothing is static and it is a human
 convention that we call things that are different the same; be they immediately, as when we call two mountains the same by name, though different
  proportions, different colors, smells, etc. Or in time as when we call a young man and an old man a "man" . It is to our feeling that we know our
   experience is our own, that no other can know our experience, so we know we are one and indivisible. And all things are one in themselves and so
    all is one, for <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> is not parts (otherwise reason tells us, it would not be one, but a composite) and it is not whole (because it is not made 
    of parts) <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> can only be everything all at once. But <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> is not Static as Parmenides claims, it is in Flux and always changing and its
     change is not pre ordained. <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> is quite simply, that everything is different and by virtue of this fact we are united as one, for the fact
      that we are different is the unity of all things. So <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> is different upon itself and this is because it is chaos, and if we search our
       science and our reason we know this to be true. That everything is entropy and the world is free, because it is chaos. This I call Anarchism
        and this is <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i>.

<p class ="tab">When Parmenides says time produces statues, that things are static, we must understand this through the notion of eternal return: that the
     big bang will endlessly repeat itself and everything you are you will experience again, but different. Why different? Because it will not

      constantly on flux. That the stars we gaze upon are gone as they are statues.

The one is difference, and difference is anarchy because anarchy is the state of nature. <i><T1>The ONE</T1></i> is paradoxical, because it is different upon itself.
 If you search your reason, your feelings and you search the bulk of human knowledge you arrive at this fundamental truth: nothing is forever and 
 infinite but anarchy, which is change, chaos and freedom. 
</p>

<p class="centerp">*</p>

<p class ="tab">All the matter that ever was and ever will be began with big bang and since it has been expanding outward. So at present the universe is the same
     mass as it's beginning. The universe began when a point infinitely small, dense and hot, became different and it was it's difference, from a state
      where everything was alike to a state where things were different that marks the beginning of things.

 <i><T1>The ONE</T1></i> is like sphere, at it's center is all the matter that ever was and ever will be and this matter forms to the surface which expands relative to
 the depletion of it's center.

<p class ="tab">Man forgos his sovereignity and is therefore alienated from <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i>, which would be his natural state. Man is unique amongst the animals by virtue of
     being alienated from himself.

Sovereignty means the immanence of experience ( experience as unmediated or present ) - this is the objective of Eastern Religion, a Buddha is that
 which is not owned by passions, they perceive experience for what it is and immediately - and this is what was written at the underbelly of gnostic
  and beguine Christianity, providence meant being one with God, which was to be present and in harmony with the One, in such a state the world of 
  virtue, moral or law did not apply because one was ungovernable because an individual was not longer alienated. This is separate from the promise 
  of the religion, which is the devotion onto death where upon the gates of death man faces judgment and providence. The heretics were those that
   promised providence immediately but this meant the destruction of authority and the state.

So Anarchism is, most practically that most original point before the turn where man left immanence, which is the "wild" or "nature" and began a world
 of contemplation, which is a world of guilt and of self mutilation, which is the gambit of security and of life. In exchange for security man forgos
  his sovereignty and follows another, by following another one becomes a subject and In being a subject one is not free. 
</p>

<p class="centerp">*</p>

<p class ="tab">
    How do we live in the way of anarchy by means of immanence? In every religion first there is light and this is always the first act.
     Science requires the existence of neutrinos, which are the particles of light and these we know are static, because they move at the speed 
     pertaining to light. Neutrinos are simply from the moment of their existence, also non existent. So the One is the Light.

And if we search our feeling and our reason we know this is the truth, because the simplest of life began by directly consuming the energy of the Sun,
 which the Sun gave freely and in exchange for nothing. And all things that are alive are things which look towards the Sun, which is why plants open
  their leaves and flowers and fight to be the tallest And closest to the Sun. And all things which are alive consume energy if not directly provided
   by the sun, consume things whose energy is derived from the sun. So man has of present been at the gambit of another, which is an opinion and is not
    of truth when he proclaims that man makes the food, man makes energy, when he separates his own economy from the economy of the sun, which is the
     most general and real economy there is. If man were to reorient himself to the birds eye, which is nearest and closeset to the Sun he would 
     understand the way of truth and not the way of another.

So the Sun is <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> and the Sun is a sphere, the energy at the center flows to the surface and all that is alive emmantes from this surface to things
 we are now. And when this center is depleted, everything is brought back to the center by the strongest of forces, by a principle that cannot be 
 denied. When everything is brought back and is One it becomes different and this is Eternal Return.

 life is the way provided by the Sun. The Sun is that which gives freely and asks for nothing in return, it does not request you to perform, to follow
  commandments or to offer sacrifice or to repent. The Sun is and it's being is giving, as all things besides ourselves are, the plants which give
   themselves to the earth and to animals, the animals who give themselves to each other to ensure their mutual existence. This is the Communism of

I have said a great deal about <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i>, and it is likely I have said too much. By prescribing a quality to <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> I am always providing it an
 attribute which would make it more then <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i>. Consider what I have said then as poetic. The poet takes those things which have never occasioned 
 each other and brings them together as the chance encounter of the Umbrella and the Sewing Machine. 

 <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> then is the poetic which collapses all differences into difference itself; as a simultide which stretches experience.

<p class="centerp">*</p>

<p class ="tab">
If my reader has followed me this far I figure they have questioned the relevancy of all this then. Have I fallen into the trap of saying a great deal
 and not saying anything at all? Whether as a Poetic or as a material truth it makes no difference, in the same way that my dreams may not be manifest
  they are none the less a reality of my experience. 
</p>

<p class="centerp">*</p>

<p class ="tab">Practically it is the same which bores us and it is the same which is superficial, because to posit the sameness of identity to look past intrinsic
     difference. 

When I say this is a man and this is a woman, I am looking past irreducible differences and I am ignoring the only truth which is divine: everything is
 One and what is One is also different, because it is neither whole nor an aggregate of parts. 

An Ethics of <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i>, where we can derive the proper field of activity for our practical reason would be firstly to recognize the aforehand mentioned.
 Ethically questions of Essence in the pratical field of morals, gender, sexuality, race, etc. are meaningless: there is only difference and difference upon itself. I differ to the work of
  Poerette in order to refrain from being redundant here, I will simply say the way of <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> ends in anarchy, because in harmony with <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> my soul
   is no longer bound to law or subservience to virtue or morality, because I cannot commit Evil so an ethics of <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> is the Communism of Spirit. The anarhic one
   is opposed to the ordering of Nature; it has been forgetten, likely ever since the time of Plotinus' that to set the ethical project off from the Genesis of a "Nature"
   will be to always make Man a Slave to Nature. Wherever there is essence, there is slaverly. There is no freedom in Nature, for everything in Nature is involuntary. To follow
   one's nature is to turn away from the One towards compulsion and slavery. To be Free means to go beyond essence. 
   
   I will speak to this hopefully in another work on Poerette, which I hope to both a genealogy of their thought in Gregorian music; as the laters finest 
    exposition.

	<p class ="tab">Consider your left hand, if we measure the distance between your thumb and your index finger and your index finger to your middle finger and so
         forth we could establish a relational map of your hand. The same procedure operated on the right hand would produce identical results: say in
          both cases we find that between the tip of index and tip of your thumb there is a four inch distance and between you index and your middle
           finger there is an inch distance. And yet, despite identical relations the two objects are not the same and when you place one hand over the
            other the two do not collapse into one another.</p>

<p class ="tab">An object or a system is chiral if it is distinguishable from its mirror image; that is, it cannot be superimposed onto it. Conversely, a mirror image
 of an achiral object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called enantiomorphs (Greek,
  "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, enantiomers. A non-chiral object is called achiral (sometimes also amphichiral) and can be 
  superposed on its mirror image. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is
   impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes. This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to
    shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. Chirality is not an arbitrary 
    observation, it's critical in the sciences.</p>

    <p class ="tab">Consider first contact with an alien whose anatomy consists of a round brain, eye and mouth. Sitting with your back to the alien, you ask, “are you to
 my right, or to my left?” - not possessing any arms or anything beyond its achirality, it does not understand the question, it can understand up and
  down, back and front.</p>

  <p class ="tab">Kant rules out Leibniz’s relational theory of space proceeding from an argument from chirality. Space cannot be reduced to reflections of relation. 
The Transcendental Aesthetic posits that Space and Time are pure forms of our intuitions and the principle means through which synthetic a-priori 
knowledge is possible (i.e. Geometry, Mathematics, Physics). Synthetic because sensation (external affects) is combined with concepts (which are
 internal processes)  - both sensations and Kant's table of categories (concepts) find mutual ground in our pure intuition of space and time. It is
  their point of unity. </p>

	
<p class ="tab">By Pure Intuition, it is meant that all experience is in Space and Time and as opposed to other intuitions which are confused, pure intuition is as

 contains nothing else except the form of sensibility, which in me as subject precedes all actual impressions through which I am affected by objects.
  For I can know a priori that the objects of the senses can be intuited only in accordance with this form of sensibility. From this it follows: that
   propositions which relate merely to this form of sensory intuition will be possible and valid for objects of the senses; also, conversely, that 
   intuitions which are possible a priori can never relate to things other than objects of our senses. (§8)”</p>

<p class ="tab">Objects taken on their own produce no knowledge a- priori; they must be combined synthetically by concepts which place them in the form our sensibility
 (intuition).</p>

<p class ="tab">Consider two blades of grass that bear the same shape, color and other sensible qualities. Consider every quality possible to be made identical, the
 principle of their identity could at the last instance still be determined because they exist both in separate space and separate instances. The I 
 which I am in a mirror despite sharing identical spatial relations and sensible qualities is not the I which I am presently. The mirror is the here
  where I am not. Its existence is heterotopic - I know this sounds obtuse, hold this thought for the following section. </p>

<p class ="tab">In short all objects are united upon the principle of difference; no two things are exactly alike even in the first instance. I will get to this as a
 potential limit of our cognition, or the form of our sensability -  in the mean, I call this principle, the principle of the ONE.</p>

 <p class ="tab">I take chirality to be of relevant purpose because the empirical  <i><T1>"I"</T1></i> IS chrial: it may share the same relations but it is in no way superimposable
 over what I am. </p>


<p class="centerp" id="The Transcendental Deduction">The Transcendental Deduction</p>

<p class ="tab">First there is the Cogito, its maxim, I think therefor I am. Being is transparent to thought and thought establishes being. All the power of 
representation is contained here and until the time of Kant, it was truly believed that reason could posit the truth and being. This Kant calls, 
the Euthanasia of Reason and offers a crique of Pure Reason in order to bring reason back its proper field of conduct. I do not offer my thought as
 necessarily as an answer to the question of the possibility of a thought beyond thought or “to the outside” that has been pursued by the Limit
  Experience (by Sade, Nietzsche, Roussel, Mallarme, Blanchot, Artaud, Battaie, etc.) but I do not find this pursuit undesirable, nay do I find that 
  the ONE does not offer means to it. What follows may contradict this.</p>

  <p class ="tab">For senseability to become an experience it must be united under the header of an <i><T1>“I”</T1></i>; this is the unity of apperception where the manifold of 
senseability is united with the concepts of understanding. Should my senseability arrive under the header of “Walter hears this, Sussane sees that,
 Dustin smells roses, my thumb feels that, my feet this, etc etc” then this array would effectively be schizophrenia (or at least, under the direction
  of multiple personalities). The manifold must be subsumed under a single <i><T1>“I”</T1></i> for any experience to be possible (i.e. the ego); the linguistic “I” is
   not analytic to this, it operates according to the legislation of the understanding (this is the source of so many of our misconceptions where 
   language is taken to be an accurate representation of being)  </p>

   <p class ="tab">There is on the one hand, the transcendental ego which is a necessary condition to unite the manifold of sensibility; this exists prior to
     cognition as what Holderlin calls “the anarchy of representations” - understanding brings order to senseability. If I am a thinking thing, then 
     thought must accompany all that I am. But thought is here where I am not, it is the mirror image and my chirality. This linguistic and empirical 
     which I encounter is not the I am that I am - Kant arrives at this in a sterile way for the manifold of senseability arrives at us spontaneously
      and the form of experience is not thought, it is, we are in Space and Time by virtue of experience. So thought does not accompany all that I am,
       I am a multiplicity of functions (this is the source of our endless pursuits in the domain of the unconscious and the <i><T1>UNTHOUGHT</T1></i>) some of which
        are thought but thought itself  (to think) is not a predicate of “to be”. </p>


        <p class ="tab">The <i><T1>“I”</T1></i> as the subject which I encounter. The Transcendental I is not an object, it is a condition a-priori. </p>


        <p class ="tab">René Descartes had found initial certainty of knowledge in the deduction of the cogito ("I think, therefore I am"); Kant did not believe that any 
further metaphysical certainties could be deducted from the certainty of the <i><T1>“I.”</T1></i> </p>

<p class ="tab">That is, even the nature of that <i><T1>“I”</T1></i> could only be known as it appears to human observation (as a phenomenon), not as it is in itself.
 Hence, the Transcendental Ego is something that must be posited for human thoughts to make sense, not something known in any way.</p>

 <p class ="tab">Kant speaks of the "transcendental apperception" of the thinking subject as the capacity of that subject (the <i><T1>“I,”</T1></i> Ego, or self) to create a meaningful
 world of experience by unifying all its perceptions according to the categories of human understanding.</p>

 <p class ="tab">It must be possible for the "I think" to accompany all my representations; for otherwise something would be represented in me which could not be 
thought at all. … I call it pure apperception, to distinguish it from empirical apperception … The unity of this apperception I likewise entitle the 
transcendental unity of self-consciousness, in order to indicate the possibility of a priori knowledge arising from it. For the manifold representations,
 which are given in an intuition, would not be one and all my representations, if they did not all belong to one self-consciousness. (I. Kant, The
  Critique of Pure Reason, §16 The Original Synthetic Unity of Apperception, B131-132, translation by Norman Kemp Smith.)</p>

  <p class ="tab">The Transcendental Deduction posits a unity of differences into a <i><T1>transcendental ONE</T1></i> as a principle in the first instance, the groundwork for all 
experience. My thought is hazy here, but what I mean to say is that in the first instance we must establish <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> (transcendental I) which unites all
 the differences including itself into one thing: experience, and so when I say <i><T1></T1>the ONE</T1></i>, I mean just that, that all differences are united in the ONE
  and <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> is all there is, either in the first instance where the transcendental comes to be or as when reason posits that all empirical truth
   points to <i><T1></T1>the ONE</T1></i>. Because senseability is united in one and otherwise exists as anarchy - i.e. pure difference which is paradoxically the source 
   of its unity. <i><T1>The One</T1></i> as a chiral other. </p>

   <p class ="tab">The question as I alluded to earlier which i still have yet to work, is does this mean the ONE is but a limit and non reflection of the thing in itself?
 Or do we taken the Maimon position that differentials are themselves gateways into the thing in itself. The Hegelian position: we have access to the
  thing in itself, this is the ONE.</p>

  <p class="centerp">A brief detour to help illustrate my thought,</p>

  <p class ="tab">I lose myself when I write, I become in my fictions, the characters on the page and the scenes I describe and when I read anothers fiction, I lose 
myself in their stream and I become one with those words which to them, was likewise a loss of themselves. There are number of reasons why endless
 exegesis and the perusal of texts is a pedantic and normie activity - a sad way to waste one's life, I wish them the stupor of alcohol before this 
 - but none strike me more than this simple notion. I take it for granted that if my aforehand observation is not to be received that anyone will at
  least accept the old saying that every cell in your body is not as it was last year and that who you are today is not who you were yesterday, this
   morning, or even five minutes ago. The I which I call myself and the name you receive me under are really only conveniences, they are not analytic
    to the <i><T1>INNER EXPERIENCE</T1></i> which we have already established is <i><T1>the ONE</T1></i> and is not alike anything else nor itself - it is becoming and even this is 
    likely to far to posit. I’m sorry to break it to you but the I which subsists over time is but an illusion and a linguistic artifact. Consult the
     Ship of Thebes, Locke, Luther and the great deal of blunder that has been made a muck here. To press such statements as “This text reflects the
      truth of his character” are nonsensical. How could you think, even for a second, that my language, which I cannot even use to understand myself,
       could be used by you to understand me? </p>

       <p class ="tab">I lose myself in Sex; I am lost in the act and it is this<i><T1> DEATH</T1></i> which is the source of its glimmer and it is that glimmer which disappears in orgasm
 which is both the peak and the most unthought moment and that fall from grace where I return to myself. I lose myself in drugs and in alcohol and these
  are usually aliases for the passions which possess me to anger and to lust. </p>

  <p class ="tab">Writing is like Sex and Music is very similar too. In all three the act in its highest form is loss onto <i><T1>DEATH</T1></i>, where my chiral self disappears and I 
am met with immanence and where for an instance I become one with another floating downstream.</p> 



<p class="centerp" id="Left Nietzscheanism or Right Nietzscheanism?">Left Nietzscheanism or Right Nietzscheanism? The first and last problem is: is there a Nietzshe to begin with?</p>

<p class="centerp">*</p>

<p>When I speak of you, who is on the podium speaking? When a judge delivers the verdict and determines my character, are they saying anything about me or
 just describing the surface (the only truth with which we can, practically, abide by) - this is the outstanding problem. It is why a Judge must
  surround themselves with so many authorities and why the psychologist has the highest power in the judge. </p>

  <p class="centerp">*</p>


<p class ="tab">Typically it is given that man be judged totality by their final thought, this is the thought in it’s ripest. Historical cherry pickers have no doubt
 laid this to the dustbin.  Old Age is the sign of disability, feebleness and then there is: Youth! This could not represent the author, they are too 
 tempted to dumb witted. Take Marx: the endless exegesis, the laughable retreats of althusser ‘The epistemological rupture with Marx actually happened
  moments before he perished, this is the true Marx’. The true Marx is the Manifesto, the public Marx - no the True Marx is the unpublished, where he 
  was going, the project’s he abandoned! It is not Marx, but Marx and Engels! That is the true Marx! People speak as though Barthes and Foucault had
   not done the author dirty in this regard. The author is dead -  the same weakness suffocates our intellectuals as when they are confronted with the
    death of the god, the death of man -  they fail to see death as an invitation to funeral. </p>

<p class="centerp">*</p>


<p class ="tab">I say there is no Nietzsche and I say that I am Nietzsche. I am the mad hatter and the anti - chirist. I say, you can be Nietsche too, for in the wake
 of his death I invite you to a funeral, a funeral on the banks of a vast river. Put your toes in it, then your mouth, let it drown you till you are 
 the river and you are the funeral and you are death and you are that fleeting moment. This is the duration. </p>

 <p class="centerp">*</p>

<p class ="tab">Was Nietzsche nothing but that fleeting moment? Was Nietzsche the Headache or the Syphilis? Was Nietzsche the manuscripts, the private journals or 
the Dionysian Dithyrambs? Is the mad Nietzsche the Nietzsche because it was the final Nietzsche? Is the Nietzsche the Tragedy? </p>

<p class="centerp">*</p>

<p class ="tab">What a spoil it is to waste such good minds on such questions which are regularly confirmed in both thought and experience. </p>

<p class="centerp">*</p>

<p class ="tab">I am but a moment which is constantly disappearing, I am asphyxiated in thought and remembered in ink, but what I am is no more. The power of Nietzsche,
 if we are to speak positively of this thing, which I know nothing of but this: That I am no more then now and this now is the now I am to be forever.
  For this is the ink and this is thought and this is what you read and at that moment we are in the funeral, along the same river and drowning together
   in this thought. I am not a Man, I am Dynamite. </p>

   <p class="centerp">*</p>

<p class ="tab">Every moment is a moment that is gone; memory confirms this. And every moment is a moment that I relive, but it will be different, because it will not
 be this: I which accompanies it. This is the duration. Every moment is a moment that is infinite but it is also particular. It is for this reason that
  Parmendies thinks of us as statues; static. The horror that regularly accompanies this thought is ten fold under my proposition: every moment is a
   statue and is experienced infinitely. So the circle of the eternal return is indeed a circle, but every vector is a straight line. Death is but
    another statue, which you will experience and will experience infinitely and with no change.  There is nothing to fear for the present you, which
     has already past by the time you have reached this word, for you will read these words again and infinitely -  and likewise death really is that
      abyss. </p>

<p class ="tab">If there is to be a left and right nietzscheanism it is reduced to what Will to Power means? This is not a correct reading of Nietzsche, I could care
 less what he says regarding this, in the same way that although Newton discovered gravity, I could care less about his conclusions considering myself.
  What is certain about the Will to Power is that all things,  as Heraclitus said, are at WAR. War is the way of things, and it is only the way of
   appearance and of opinion which say otherwise. War is the ONE. Without war things would be, in the most real and sincere way, truly frozen. The
    Will to Power is simply: that things desire to maintain their form they use a power to do this and a higher power must break this form. Power 
    here being, one of the most empty of terms  - Politically it does not exist.</p>
